#### Pre-Owned Vehicle Market Web App with Interactive Models

## Description
Welcome friends! This code uses Python scripts and Streamlit to create a user friendly web application to help prospective buyers search and explore the US pre-owned vehicle market. Our goal is to anticipate all of the buyers wants and needs and give them the tools to make an informed decision on their next used vehicle. Whether they are purchasing or wanting to sell, we want to be able to give them the peace of mind knowing they have made the right decision. 
The app uses interactive models for the user to see whats currently on the market, compare vehicle prices by variables such as manufacturer, mileage, and condition, and get an idea of the market conditions. We hope, by using our web app, we can make the process of buying & selling a used vehicle easy, fun, and informative!
